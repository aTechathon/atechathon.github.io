[AEC Technology Hackathon 2014 ]( https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/aec-technology-hackathon-2014/ )

> Organized in parallel with the AEC Technology Symposium, the weekend-long AEC Technology Hackathon is an event for programmers, web developers, and AEC experts to collaborate on novel ideas and processes for the AEC industry. There is a great need for the building industry to start developing their own solutions and here is the chance to get started! Hackers will have a day and a half to brainstorm concepts, develop projects, and present results to a panel of industry experts. An impressive collection of Hackathon Leaders will be present to offer guidance and support for hackers throughout the competition.


You have two ways of viewing the aTechathon files:

* Web page hosted on GitHub: [atechathon.github.io]( http://atechathon.github.io/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/atechathon]( https://github.com/atechathon/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


### System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
